    <h2 class="odd">Learn How to Cook Kale Caesar Salad</h2>
    <p>Traditional Caesar salad that uses kale instead of romaine! Makes 4 side-dish portions, but you can make it a main dish meal by topping it with a grilled protein, such as chicken or salmon! You may have leftover dressing, depending on how much you like. It keeps well in the refrigerator for up to a week. If you don’t think you like kale or that your family wouldn’t eat it, I’m here to let you in on a little secret: kale needs to be massaged first! As you rub-down the kale leaves with a little olive oil, the leaves darken and shrink up making it soft and quite delicious to eat. While there are many ways you can dress a salad, my family is a huge fan of my shredded Kale Caesar Salad. Kale Caesar salad is the perfect creamy, crunchy salad—and it's packed with nutrients and antioxidants. Raw kale has the highest levels of minerals and antioxidants. Cooking may reduce the nutritional value of kale, so this raw salad is a great way to get the full benefit of those nutrients (though most nutritionists say it's best to eat both raw and cooked kale dishes). If you don’t know how to prepare kale, you can end up with a tough, chewy dish, but with our tips you can learn how to make this easy and simple salad without any tough pieces or bitterness.The dressing is full of classic Caesar flavor from garlic, lemon juice, and anchovies. It's the perfect addition to your favorite steak dinner or pasta dish.</p>
