    <h2>Learn How to Cook Salmon on the Stove</h2>
        <p>Learn how long to cook salmon on the stove with this easy pan-seared salmon recipe. The salmon fillets are simply seasoned with salt, pepper, and capers. Garnish with slices of lemon.</p>
        <br><p>This recipe is simple yet delicious. I skipped the capers and used a normal non-stick frying pan. Poured the olive oil into the pan instead of coating the salmon with it. Perfectly accompanied by my favorite salad composed of tomatoes, onions, feta cheese with lemon juice and olive oil. Thanks!</p>
    <h2>Ingridients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>4 (6 ounce) fillets salmon</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons olive oil</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons capers</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>⅛ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li>4 slices lemon</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat a large heavy skillet over medium heat for 3 minutes.</li>
        <li>Coat salmon fillets with olive oil; place skin-side down in the preheated skillet and increase heat to high. Sprinkle with capers, salt, and pepper; cook for 3 minutes on one side. Turn salmon fillets over; continue to cook until salmon flakes easily with a fork, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Transfer salmon to individual plates and garnish with lemon slices.</li>
    </ol>
